# Tutorial
So basically just make a stub using any stub maker like Lunar, then attach it to the stub here and add your image in the html!
Save to your index.html and upload to your website (use 000webhostapp if you don't wanna pay for a domain)


# Reminder

Please just read on how to do it before asking me how to make it
